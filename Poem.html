        <h1>Every Job Has a First day</h1>
        <h2>By REBECCA GAYLE HOWELL</h2>

        <p>Slade was pulling minnows out of the dry river<br>
            the day we met. Puddles, more or less, was what<br>
            was left. But what could live wanted to and tried,<br>
            treading narrow circles, a glide of brittle ﬁns.<br>
            He wore those rubber boots, though the sun was<br>
            an anvil, and very little wet; he smiled, I remember<br>
            that, his nickel smile right at me, his ﬁngers<br>
            letting fall the small ﬁsh muscles into a bag ﬁlled<br>
            with yellow tap. I didn’t ask his name, or what<br>
            it was he thought he was doing, but we talked,<br>
            I listened as he taught me to relax the hand just enough.<br>
            They can smell, he said, the oils our pores release<br>
            when we tense to catch. You have to believe it,<br>
            he said. You don’t mean any harm.<br>
        </p>
